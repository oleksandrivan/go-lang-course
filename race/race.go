The race condition happens because the counter++ operation is not atomic (indivisible) and involves reading, incrementing, and writing, 
which can be interleaved between the two goroutines. When two goroutines perform this sequence of steps on the same variable simultaneously, 
they can overwrite each otherâ€™s changes, leading to an incorrect final value of counter.
